Oxy- gen from the air that remains in the bottle, in the space between the wine level and the opening of the bottle (the so-called “headspace”), causes oxidation of the wine. The oxi- dation of the wine renders the wine unpleasant in taste. [002] A device for preserving wine is known from D11. This device consists of a hand- actuated vacuum pump that is used to remove air (and therefore also oxygen) from the headspace of the opened bottle. A disadvantage of this device is that the volatile aroma substances included in the wine are also removed by the pumping process. Another dis- advantage is that many hand actuations are necessary to remove sufficient air from the headspace. [003] The present invention provides a device that instead of creating a vacuum simply replaces air (and therefore also oxygen) in the headspace with another gas comprising less oxygen than air. A preferred other gas is an inert gas. This is achieved by injecting the other gas (e.g. the inert gas) into the headspace. The injected gas pushes the air out of the headspace. [004] By inert gas we mean a gas that does not undergo any chemical reaction with the volatile aroma substances included in the wine. Examples of inert gases are carbon di- oxide, nitrogen and argon. Argon is the most preferred inert gas, because it is heavier than oxygen and heavier than air, so that a layer of argon creates a “gas cap” on top of the wine level. Even a very small volume of argon is sufficient to create the gas cap and prevent the oxidation processes. 2022/P/EN Page 19 of 27 Claims filed together with the second European patent application: II.1. Method for preserving wine in a bottle, wherein the composition of a gas in the headspace of the bottle is modified. II.2. Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage in a bottle, wherein the amount of oxygen in the headspace of the bottle is reduced. II.3. Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.2, wherein an inert gas is injected directly into the headspace of the bottle. II.4. Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.3, wherein the inert gas is carbon dioxide. II.5. Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.3 or II.4, wherein the inert gas is exclusively nitrogen. II.6. Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.3, wherein the inert gas is a mixture of carbon dioxide with nitrogen or with argon. II.7. Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.3, wherein the inert gas is argon. II.8. Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.5, wherein the alcoholic beverage is wine and the wine is contained in an opened bottle. II.9. Method for preserving an alcoholic beverage according to claim II.7, wherein the alcoholic beverage is wine and the wine is contained in an opened bottle. 2022/P/EN Page 20 of 27 Assume in the following that documents D11, D12, and D13 are prior art in accordance with Art. 54(1) and (2) EPC: Document D11 [001] This document discloses a vacuum pump that is used to extract air or oxygen from an opened bottle in order to preserve the wine contained in the opened bottle. [002] The principle is very simple. The opened bottle is closed with a water-tight and air- tight reusable stopper. The stopper is easily applied onto the neck of the bottle to her- metically seal the opening of the bottle. The stopper can be easily removed again from the bottle by hand. The stopper has a one-way valve through which air and oxygen from within the bottle can be extracted using a vacuum pump. In this way the quality of the wine in the opened bottle can be preserved for many days. 2022/P/EN Page 21 of 27 Document D12 [001] Devices for household use are known for introducing carbon dioxide into water. Carbon dioxide is a gas that is contained in a pressurized capsule within the device. Once carbon dioxide is released into water, the gas and the water undergo a chemical reaction to provide carbonic acid, which gives water pleasant taste and fizz. With the help of such devices sparkling water can be prepared inexpensively from tap water. [002] We have now found that the same devices can be used to inject the carbon diox- ide into wine. When carbon dioxide is injected into wine, a similar chemical reaction oc- curs as when carbon dioxide is added to water. Thereby a pleasant fizz is added to the wine. We have additionally noted that a part of the injected carbon dioxide reaches the headspace of the bottle and pushes the air (and therefore also oxygen) contained therein out of the headspace of the bottle. Moreover, we found that wine can be better preserved when carbon dioxide is injected therein. 2022/P/EN Page 22 of 27 Document D13 [001] This document discloses an industrial method for preserving liquids. It is known that fish oil is easily spoiled by oxygen upon storage. The method consists of injecting nitrogen into the headspace of a bottle filled with fish oil before closing the bottle and transporting such bottles to the various points of sale. [002] It is known by the skilled person that nitrogen is lighter than oxygen. Therefore, the nitrogen must be injected just above the level of the fish oil within the bottle. Nitrogen evacuates through the opening of the bottle, but some oxygen is removed as well. After injecting a volume of nitrogen equal to 20 times of the volume of the headspace into the headspace of the bottle, virtually no oxygen can be traced in the headspace of the bot- tle. [003] Clearly, this method can be applied to many types of liquid, such as perfumes and beer. 2022/P/EN Page 23 of 27",
