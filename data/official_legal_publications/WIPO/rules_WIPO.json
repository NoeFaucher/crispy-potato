Non-compliance with this Rule may \nbe authorized if the authenticity of the content is not in question and the \nrequirements for good reproduction are not in jeopardy. \n11.13   Special Requirements for Drawings \n \n(a)  Drawings shall be executed in durable, black, sufficiently dense and dark, \nuniformly thick and well-defined, lines and strokes without colorings. \n \n(b)  Cross-sections shall be indicated by oblique hatching which should not \nimpede the clear reading of the reference signs and leading lines. \n \n(c)  The scale of the drawings and the distinctness of their graphical execution \nshall be such that a photographic reproduction with a linear reduction in size to \ntwo-thirds would enable all details to be distinguished without difficulty. \n \n(d)  When, in exceptional cases, the scale is given on a drawing, it shall be \nrepresented graphically. \n \n(e)  All numbers, letters and reference lines, appearing on the drawings, shall \nbe simple and clear.  Brackets, circles or inverted commas shall not be used in \nassociation with numbers and letters. \n \n(f)  All lines in the drawings shall, ordinarily, be drawn with the aid of drafting \ninstruments. \n \n(g)  Each element of each figure shall be in proper proportion to each of the \nother elements in the figure, except where the use of a different proportion is \nindispensable for the clarity of the figure. \n \n(h)  The height of the numbers and letters shall not be less than 0.32 cm.  For \nthe lettering of drawings, the Latin and, where customary, the Greek alphabets \nshall be used. \n \n(i)  The same sheet of drawings may contain several figures.  Where figures \non two or more sheets form in effect a single complete figure, the figures on the \nseveral sheets shall be so arranged that the complete figure can be assembled \nwithout concealing any part of any of the figures appearing on the various sheets. \n \n(j)  The different figures shall be arranged on a sheet or sheets without wasting \nspace, preferably in an upright position, clearly separated from one another.  \nWhere the figures are not arranged in an upright position, they shall be presented \nsideways with the top of the figures at the left side of the sheet. \n \n(k)  The different figures shall be numbered in Arabic numerals consecutively \nand independently of the numbering of the sheets. \n \n(l)  Reference signs not mentioned in the description shall not appear in the \ndrawings, and vice versa. \n \n(m)  The same features, when denoted by reference signs, shall, throughout \nthe international application, be denoted by the same signs. \n \n(n)  If the drawings contain a large number of reference signs, it is strongly \nrecommended to attach a separate sheet listing all reference signs and the features \ndenoted by them. \n11.14   Later Documents \n \nRules 10, and 11.1 to 11.13, also apply to any document – for example, \nreplacement sheets, amended claims, translations – submitted after the filing of \nthe international application. \n"

The receiving Office may, subject to \nArticle 30(2)(a) as applicable by virtue of Article 30(3), also transmit to the \nInternational Searching Authority any further documents relating to such an \nearlier search which it considers useful to that Authority for the purposes of \ncarrying out the international search. \n \n(b)  Notwithstanding paragraph (a), a receiving Office may notify the \nInternational Bureau by April 14, 2016 that it may, on request of the applicant \nsubmitted together with the international application, decide not to transmit the \nresults of an earlier search to the International Searching Authority.

The correction of a priority claim may include the \naddition of any indication referred to in Rule 4.10. \n \n(b)  Any notice referred to in paragraph (a) received by the receiving Office \nor the International Bureau after the applicant has made a request for early \npublication under Article 21(2)(b) shall be considered not to have been submitted, \nunless that request is withdrawn before the technical preparations for international \npublication have been completed. \n \n(c)  Where the correction or addition of a priority claim causes a change in the \npriority date, any time limit which is computed from the previously applicable \npriority date and which has not already expired shall be computed from the \npriority date as so changed. \n26bis.2   Defects in Priority Claims \n \n(a)  Where the receiving Office or, if the receiving Office fails to do so, the \nInternational Bureau, finds in relation to a priority claim: \n \n(i) that the international application has an international filing date which \nis later than the date on which the priority period expired and that a request for \nrestoration of the right of priority under Rule 26bis.3 has not been submitted; \n \n(ii) that the priority claim does not comply with the requirements of \nRule 4.10;  or \n \n(iii) that any indication in the priority claim is inconsistent with the \ncorresponding indication appearing in the priority document; \nthe receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the case may be, shall invite \nthe applicant to correct the priority claim.  In the case referred to in item (i), where \nthe international filing date is within two months from the date on which the \npriority period expired, the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the \ncase may be, shall also notify the applicant of the possibility of submitting a \nrequest for the restoration of the right of priority in accordance with Rule 26bis.3, \nunless the receiving Office has notified the International Bureau under \nRule 26bis.3(j) of the incompatibility of Rule 26bis.3(a) to (i) with the national \nlaw applied by that Office. \n \n(b)  If the applicant does not, before the expiration of the time limit under \nRule 26bis.1(a), submit a notice correcting the priority claim, that priority claim \nshall, subject to paragraph (c), for the purposes of the procedure under the Treaty, \nbe considered not to have been made (“considered void”) and the receiving Office \nor the International Bureau, as the case may be, shall so declare and shall inform \nthe applicant accordingly.  Any notice correcting the priority claim which is \nreceived before the receiving Office or the International Bureau, as the case may \nbe, so declares and not later than one month after the expiration of that time limit \nshall be considered to have been received before the expiration of that time limit. \n \n(c)  A priority claim shall not be considered void only because: \n \n(i) the indication of the number of the earlier application referred to in \nRule 4.10(a)(ii) is missing; \n \n(ii) an indication in the priority claim is inconsistent with the \ncorresponding indication appearing in the priority document;  or \n \n(iii) the international application has an international filing date which is \nlater than the date on which the priority period expired, provided that the \ninternational filing date is within the period of two months from that date. \n \n(d)  Where the receiving Office or the International Bureau has made a \ndeclaration under paragraph (b) or where the priority claim has not been \nconsidered void only because paragraph (c) applies, the International Bureau shall \npublish, together with the international application, information concerning the \npriority claim as prescribed by the Administrative Instructions, as well as any \ninformation submitted by the applicant concerning such priority claim which is \nreceived by the International Bureau prior to the completion of the technical \npreparations for international publication.  Such information shall be included in \nthe communication under Article 20 where the international application is not \npublished by virtue of Article 64(3). \n \n(e)  Where the applicant wishes to correct or add a priority claim but the time \nlimit under Rule 26bis.1 has expired, the applicant may, prior to the expiration of \n30 months from the priority date and subject to the payment of a special fee whose \namount shall be fixed in the Administrative Instructions, request the International \nBureau to publish information concerning the matter, and the International Bureau \nshall promptly publish such information. \n26bis.3   Restoration of Right of Priority by Receiving Office \n \n(a)  Where the international application has an international filing date which \nis later than the date on which the priority period expired but within the period of \ntwo months from that date, the receiving Office shall, on the request of the \napplicant, and subject to paragraphs (b) to (g) of this Rule, restore the right of \npriority if the Office finds that a criterion applied by it (“criterion for restoration”) \nis satisfied, namely, that the failure to file the international application within the \npriority period: \n \n(i) occurred in spite of due care required by the circumstances having been \ntaken;  or \n \n(ii) was unintentional. \nEach receiving Office shall apply at least one of those criteria and may apply both \nof them. \n \n(b)  A request under paragraph (a) shall: \n \n(i) be filed with the receiving Office within the time limit applicable under \nparagraph (e); \n \n(ii) state the reasons for the failure to file the international application \nwithin the priority period;  and \n \n(iii) preferably be accompanied by any declaration or other evidence \nrequired under paragraph (f). \n \n(c)  Where a priority claim in respect of the earlier application is not contained \nin the international application, the applicant shall submit, within the time limit \napplicable under paragraph (e), a notice under Rule 26bis.1(a) adding the priority \nclaim. \n \n(d)  The submission of a request under paragraph (a) may be subjected by the \nreceiving Office to the payment to it, for its own benefit, of a fee for requesting \nrestoration, payable within the time limit applicable under paragraph (e).  The \namount of that fee, if any, shall be fixed by the receiving Office.  The time limit \nfor payment of the fee may be extended, at the option of the receiving Office, for \na period of up to two months from the expiration of the time limit applicable under \nparagraph (e). \n \n(e)  The time limit referred to in paragraphs (b)(i), (c) and (d) shall be \ntwo months from the date on which the priority period expired, provided that, \nwhere the applicant makes a request for early publication under Article 21(2)(b), \nany request under paragraph (a) or any notice referred to in paragraph (c) \nsubmitted, or any fee referred to in paragraph (d) paid, after the technical \npreparations for international publication have been completed shall be \nconsidered as not having been submitted or paid in time. \n \n(f)  The receiving Office may require that a declaration or other evidence in \nsupport of the statement of reasons referred to in paragraph (b)(ii) be filed with it \nwithin a time limit which shall be reasonable under the circumstances. \n \n(g)  The receiving Office shall not refuse, totally or in part, a request under \nparagraph (a) without giving the applicant the opportunity to make observations \non the intended refusal within a time limit which shall be reasonable under the \ncircumstances.  Such notice of intended refusal by the receiving Office may be \nsent to the applicant together with any invitation to file a declaration or other \nevidence under paragraph (f). \n \n(h)  The receiving Office shall promptly: \n \n(i) notify the International Bureau of the receipt of a request under \nparagraph (a); \n \n(ii) make a decision upon the request; \n \n(iii) notify the applicant and the International Bureau of its decision and the \ncriterion for restoration upon which the decision was based; \n \n(iv) subject to paragraph (h-bis), transmit to the International Bureau all \ndocuments received from the applicant relating to the request under paragraph (a) \n(including a copy of the request itself, any statement of reasons referred to in \nparagraph (b)(ii) and any declaration or other evidence referred to in \nparagraph (f)). \n \n(h-bis)  The receiving Office shall, upon a reasoned request by the applicant \nor on its own decision, not transmit documents or parts thereof received in relation \nto the request under paragraph (a), if it finds that: \n \n(i) this document or part thereof does not obviously serve the purpose of \ninforming the public about the international application;  \n \n(ii) publication or public access to any such document or part thereof \nwould clearly prejudice the personal or economic interests of any person;  and  \n \n(iii) there is no prevailing public interest to have access to that document or \npart thereof.   \nWhere the receiving Office decides not to transmit documents or parts thereof to \nthe International Bureau, it shall notify the International Bureau accordingly. \n \n(i)  Each receiving Office shall inform the International Bureau of which of \nthe criteria for restoration it applies and of any subsequent changes in that respect.  \nThe International Bureau shall promptly publish such information in the Gazette. \n \n(j)  If, on October 5, 2005, paragraphs (a) to (i) are not compatible with the \nnational law applied by the receiving Office, those paragraphs shall not apply in \nrespect of that Office for as long as they continue not to be compatible with that \nlaw, provided that the said Office informs the International Bureau accordingly \nby April 5, 2006.

If that copy \nis not furnished to the International Preliminary Examining Authority because the \napplicant failed to comply with the requirements of Rule 17.1, and if that earlier \napplication was not filed with that Authority in its capacity as a national Office or \nthe priority document is not available to that Authority from a digital library in \naccordance with the Administrative Instructions, the international preliminary \nexamination report may be established as if the priority had not been claimed. \n \n(b)  If the application whose priority is claimed in the international application \nis in a language other than the language or one of the languages of the \nInternational Preliminary Examining Authority, that Authority may, where the \nvalidity of the priority claim is relevant for the formulation of the opinion referred \nto in Article 33(1), invite the applicant to furnish a translation in the said language \nor one of the said languages within two months from the date of the invitation.  If \nthe translation is not furnished within that time limit, the international preliminary \nexamination report may be established as if the priority had not been claimed. \n66.8   Form of Amendments \n \n(a)  Subject to paragraph (b), when amending the description or the drawings, \nthe applicant shall be required to submit a replacement sheet for every sheet of \nthe international application which, on account of an amendment, differs from the \nsheet previously filed.  The replacement sheet or sheets shall be accompanied by \na letter which shall draw attention to the differences between the replaced sheets \nand the replacement sheets, shall indicate the basis for the amendment in the \napplication as filed and shall preferably also explain the reasons for the \namendment. \n \n(b)  Where the amendment consists in the deletion of passages or in minor \nalterations or additions, the replacement sheet referred to in paragraph (a) may be \na copy of the relevant sheet of the international application containing the \nalterations or additions, provided that the clarity and direct reproducibility of that \nsheet are not adversely affected.  To the extent that any amendment results in the \ncancellation of an entire sheet, that amendment shall be communicated in a letter \nwhich shall preferably also explain the reasons for the amendment. \n \n(c)  When amending the claims, Rule 46.5 shall apply mutatis mutandis.  The \nset of claims submitted under Rule 46.5 as applicable by virtue of this paragraph \nshall replace all the claims originally filed or previously amended under \nArticles 19 or 34, as the case may be. \n"
